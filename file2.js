// Intro to variables 

// Variables can store some information 
// we can use that information later 
// we can change that information later

// declare a variable 
// Name of the variable are case sensitive
var firstName = "Subh";

// use a variable 
console.log (firstName);

// change a value
firstName = "Neha";
console.log (firstName);

// even if we don't write var then also it will create a variable this can create a problem for us...
